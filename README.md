# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. The projects provides access to multiple datasets. Using PySpark, we are able to analyze the dataset and provide numbers to the client.

## Purpose
To analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program.

## Results and Analysis

* The dataset that was selected did not yield any paid reviews from the Vine program. 

* The dataset showed 242889 5-star reviews from unpaid members from a total of 403807 total reviews.

* 60.15% of total reviews are 5 stars.


## Summary
Unfortunately, the analysis was inconclusive as no paid Vine reviews were found for the selected dataset. The analysis will need to be redone with another dataset.
